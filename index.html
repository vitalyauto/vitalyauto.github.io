        <p>Our service begins with a comprehensive diagnosis to pinpoint the exact cause of failure in the EME unit of
          your BMW. Following this, we undertake all necessary hardware and software repairs. To guarantee full
          functionality, we conduct rigorous testing on the unit, ensuring it performs effectively both as an inverter
          and a DC to DC power supply.
          Please note that installing a pre-owned EME unit is not feasible as it is secured with a VIN-specific lock and
          an immobilizer security code, ensuring each unit is matched to its original vehicle for safety and security.
        </p>
        <p> Common Symptoms </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vehicle does not go into gear</li>
          <li>Vehicle does not charge</li>
          <li>No communication with EME</li>
          <li>Warning Lights Pertaining to High Voltage Battery or Charging</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The vehicle must be brought to our workshop at the owner's expense for a preliminary diagnostic evaluation.
          Upon assessment, if your vehicle is suitable, we will undertake the EME module recovery. Reasons for
          ineligibility may include extensive circuit damage, irreparable board-level destruction, evidence of
          tampering, or previous repair attempts that compromise the integrity of the unit. In instances where the
          vehicle does not qualify, a diagnostic fee of $200 will be charged. </p>

        <p>Your vehicle needs to be transported to our service center, which is the responsibility of the owner, for an
          initial diagnostic check. Post-evaluation, if your vehicle meets our criteria, we will proceed with the
          recovery of the high voltage battery. Ineligibility for service may arise due to severe circuitry damage,
          beyond-repair damage at the board level, signs of tampering, or prior repair attempts that have adversely
          affected the unit's integrity. Should your vehicle not be eligible for recovery, a diagnostic fee of $200 will
          be applied.
          .</p>
        <p> Our trained technicians start with a comprehensive diagnostic to pinpoint issues with your vehicle's high
          voltage battery. They then meticulously repair both hardware and software components to restore full
          functionality. Rigorous performance tests follow to ensure the battery meets our high standards. We verify the
          battery's reliability through a final inspection before releasing the vehicle. You receive a fully functional,
          tested, and verified high voltage battery, ensuring your satisfaction and safety. </p>
